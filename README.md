# michR

Files to accompany the Introduction to R programming lecture in MICHR's Bayesian 
Workshop Series, Fall 2019. You can find the instructor's slides here:

These sides contain the same content as the file BoonstraCourseNotes.pdf in this
repository. 

I have implemented many of the ideas and pedagogies that Garrett Grolemund and 
the other professional educators at RStudio teach in their workshops and licensed 
for use under [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

These materials include
